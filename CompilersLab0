	Throughout reading the books and doing my own research I have decided to pick javaScript to build my compiler. I decided that it was the best choice for me. Since I checked out some compilers online and I have read many forums I came to a list of goals for my compiler.
1. De-bugging
2. Optimization
3. Casting and Type-Checking
4. I want it to run quickly, or proportionately to the workload or length of code.
5. I want it to be easy to read and interpreted and to never be misleading
6. I want it to be solid and never have errors go undetected.
